# Activity 3
This folder contains all the files necessary for the third activity in the ENSE271 project.

## Contents
### User Story Map
The user story map as of June 1, 2021. Note that the PDF **does not** contain the
extra descriptions containing the full stories for each card, which can only be
seen on the website. This clarification was originally missing from the last activity.
The complete storyboard can be viewed on
[StoriesOnBoard](https://landofooo.storiesonboard.com/m/copy-of-roasted-sugar-maple-nuts-usm).

To read the PDF properly, the pages have to be laid out as a grid. Their are two
numbers on the top left of the document. The first number indicates the row and the
second indicates the column.

### Meeting Notes
These notes include all the previous notes, as well as new insight from the June 1,
2021 customer check in regarding high-fidelity prototype feedback.
