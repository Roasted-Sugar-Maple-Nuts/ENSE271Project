# Activity 1
This folder contains all the files necessary for the first activity in the
ENSE271 project.

## Contents
### ENSE271 Group Outline
A document containing an overview of the project, including the team members,
project background and needs, customers, etc. This file is practically identical to
the project README.md with the inclusion of assumptions and constraints.

### Empathy Map
The empathy map created with data from the initial project discussion.

### Affinity Diagram
The affinity diagram created with data from the initial project discussion.

### User Story Map
**Note:** The PDF file does not contain the extra descriptions with the complete
stories for each card.

The user story map as of May 18, 2021. The content is subject to change as more
ideas possibly come into fruition. The most recent changes can be viewed on
[StoriesOnBoard](https://landofooo.storiesonboard.com/m/copy-of-roasted-sugar-maple-nuts-usm).

To read it properly, the pages have to be laid out as a grid. Their are two numbers
on the top left of the document. The first number indicates the row and the
second indicates the column.

### Meeting Notes
These notes contain helpful information provided by the customers. The first set
came from the initial project discussion and were used as research for eventually
creating a minimum viable product. The second set came from the checkpoint on May
17, 2021. These contain feedback from the customers and additional potentially useful
information.
