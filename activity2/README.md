# Activity 2
This folder contains all the files necessary for the second activity in the
ENSE271 project.

## Contents
### User Story Map
The user story map as of May 27, 2021. Note that the PDF **does not** contain the
extra descriptions for each card, which can only be seen on the website. This
clarification was originally missing from the last activity. The complete storyboard
can be viewed on
[StoriesOnBoard](https://landofooo.storiesonboard.com/m/copy-of-roasted-sugar-maple-nuts-usm).

To read the PDF properly, the pages have to be laid out as a grid. Their are two
numbers on the top left of the document. The first number indicates the row and the
second indicates the column.
