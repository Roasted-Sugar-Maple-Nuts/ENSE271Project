### IDA Map
This shows a slightly modified IDA map. Different majors can be selected with the
list on the top right. When hovering over the map, the rows and columns are
highlighted so that it is easier to read. The cursor changed to a hand to show that
something can be clicked.

### Ideal IDA Map
When a cell is clicked, the table expands to show more information. The information
will change depending on which cell on the course row was clicked. The most important
part is the description for why the GA was selected for the course. As discussed in
the meeting, it would also be nice to see what course content might acheive that
attribute. Signifiers that had to be explained with a legend like the different
coloured cell and the letter mark can be explained succinctly within the information,
making everything discoverable and easy to use.

This is called ideal because while the feature would be useful, it might not be
possible to implement it with the constraints of the project.

### Minimum Documentation
If the IDA map is not possible, the documentation for GA reasoning should at the very
least be easily accessible. Instead of modifying the table, clicking a cell might link
to a seperate course page, then scroll down to the appropriate GA.
