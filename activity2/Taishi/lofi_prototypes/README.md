Here are my prototypes that I felt were worthwhile to share. There were more, but they
were lacking in content or were kind of obvious (e.g. log in screen layout).

### Interactive IDA Map
An explanation is provided in the folder.

### Submission screen
A small idea for how selecting an OBA would work. The main idea was mostly to say that
a draft feature should be implemented if the OBAs are submitted with forms. Otherwise,
the layout should be changed to select by course and then attribute rather than a single
attribute per course.

### View submitted OBA screen
When searching for OBAs, the layout would be similar to other search sites with the
results in a list, filter options to the left, and searching at the top right.
To reduce clutter, each course can expand to show their OBAs. The idea of having the
same courses with different terms be a separate item would likely have to be revised.
