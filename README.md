## Project description
As part of the accreditation process managed by Engineers Canada, engineering programs offered by the University of Regina must prove that graduating students possess 12 attributes defined by the organization. To manage this, the accreditation admin at the university layed out the IDA (Introduced, Developed, Assessed) map spreadsheet. The spreadsheet shows which courses have what attributes, as well as whether data has been provided by professors in the form of an Outcomes Based Assessment (OBA). The OBA is used to see if students are demonstrating a single attribute, which the accreditation admin chooses, by selecting a specific indicator for that attribute.


## Business need
If it was not apparent, the process is very prone to confusion, especially to professors new to the attributes, the IDA map, and OBA. Professors unfamiliar with the OBA process are likely to not send data or send in incorrect data. Each part of the process is documented with separate files, of which copies must be sent to each professor by admin. 
The main goal of the project is to make this process more simple to the staff. Our group will first focus our attention on facilitating ease of access to information on the graduation attributes and the OBA process for professors. The secondary focus will be to provide a resource to help collect OBA data.
